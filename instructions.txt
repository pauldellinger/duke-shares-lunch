To clone to your vm:

nano ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

copy what's in there, then go to github settings, add it as an SSH key. 
Then do

git clone git@github.com:pauldellinger/duke-shares-lunch.git

You should have the file system in your vm as duke-shares-lunch


To set up the REST API, type the line

./update.sh

Then you should be able to preform select queries on the database
using curl. For example, SELECT * from registeredusers; becomes

curl http://localhost:3000/registeredusers |python -m json.tool

The |python -m json.tool part just formats the json result.
Foreign keys are also supported by postgrest. To get the seller and buyer names
for a particular purchase, use

curl http://localhost:3000/purchase?select=activeseller(registereduser(name)),registereduser(uid,name) |python -m json.tool

This query automatically finds the foreign key to activeseller in purchase.
It then finds the foreign key to registered user from activeseller, and finds the name
for that uid. This is the seller's name. 
It also finds the key to registered user directly from purchase, bid.
This is the buyer's name. 
This link won't work as written, because paranthesees can't be put in a URL. '(' is encoded as %28 
and ')' is encoded as %29, so instead we use

curl http://localhost:3000/purchase?select=activeseller%28registereduser%28name%29%29,registereduser%28uid,name%29 |python -m json.tool


To modify the database, type 

nano api-schema.sql
*make modifications* 
Then:
 
sudo docker cp api-schema.sql  tutorial:/api-schema.sql

sudo docker exec -it tutorial psql -U postgres -f api-schema.sql postgres

Then when you run ./postgrest tutorial.conf again it will be serving the updated version

I think that's about it for now.
